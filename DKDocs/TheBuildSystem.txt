**** The Build System ****

DigitalKnob rely's on SVN and CMake

SVN will always be installed
CMake will always be installed

On certain platfroms, other Tools will be installed.
For example, Visual Studio needs to be installed before CMake.
So CMake can find visual studio when it runs. 

For resons like this, we cannot rely soley on CMake to do everything.

We need a prep app that will install SVN, CMAKE, VisualStudio, and anything technically required by CMake.


So far...   on all platforms, 
Before we can run CMake..
we need Subversion (SVN)
we need CMake
for Windows we need Visual Studio
for Mac we need Xcode
and for Linux we need cmake to also find compilers..   (build-essentials?)
